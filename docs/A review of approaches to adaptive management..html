Background 
Adaptive Management (AM) was first developed by fisheries scientists in the 1970s and 
1980s and has since been developed for a wide range of terrestrial species (Walters, 2001). 
AM has been developed as a tool for managing a wide range of cases where management 
aims to improve the status of an endangered or threatened species to cases where the aim 
is to limit the impact of an overabundant species.  
Definition of adaptive management:  
Adaptive management is an iterative process 
for continually improving management by 
learning from how current management affects 
the system. AM is therefore based on 
monitoring and evaluating past management and dev
ising alternative actions that can be 
tested against desired objectives. 
The aim of this project is to review approaches to adaptive management in order to help 
shape SNH’s conservation management work and, in particular, to inform its developing role 
in wildlife management and invasive non-native species. 
Main findings 
  Adaptive management (AM) is a tool to support effective decision making, through 
learning from system responses to past actions and adapting management strategies 
accordingly.  
   AM provides a framework for managing natural 
resources.  It is based on the principle of 
an iterative cycle of learning from past ex
perience and adapting actions to environmental 
change. To achieve an iterative learning cycle, 
AM explicitly includes the development of 
management goals, monitoring to evaluate the success of management strategies and 
iterative modifications of the management actions. AM recognises that knowledge is not 
complete so allows management to advance with incomplete and therefore uncertain 
knowledge.  
   While the idea is simple and straightforward, the actual implementation of AM has proved 
challenging. In many cases, uncertainty may lead to undesirable outcomes or inertia 
because stakeholders fail to agree on appropriate management actions. AM has a huge 
potential to reduce this uncertainty by learning and applying alternative management 
strategies.

  AM depends on monitoring to determine if
 the desired goals are being achieved. 
Furthermore, AM requires an interaction between people involved, the system and the 
ecological resource. Bridging the gap between stakeholders with different perspectives 
and objectives relating to the resource in question can be challenging. A fundamental 
component of AM is that managers should be 
willing to try out alternative management 
actions to reduce uncertainty through experimentation. The main advantages of AM are 
that it provides a mechanism for decision makers to adapt management to a changing 
environment and that it takes into account
 management alternatives and explicitly 
addresses uncertainties and minimise risks in the system.  
   This review brings together the experiences
 and expertise of many people that have used 
AM around the world; it serves as a summary of the knowledge available for further 
discussions about case studies in Scotland.

1. INTRODUCTION 
Adaptive Management (AM) is a framework fo
r managing natural resources and is based on 
the principle of an iterative cycle of learning from past experience and adapting actions to 
environmental change. To achieve an iterative l
earning cycle, AM explicitly includes the 
development of management goals, monitoring
 to evaluate the success of management 
strategies and iterative modifications of
 the management actions. AM recognises that 
knowledge is not complete so allows management to advance with incomplete and therefore 
uncertain knowledge. AM depends on monitoring
 to determine if the desired goals are being 
achieved. Furthermore, AM requires an intera
ction between people involved, the system and 
the ecological resource. Bridging the gap between stakeholders with different perspectives 
and objectives relating to the resource in question can be challenging. A fundamental 
component of AM is that managers should be 
willing to try out alternative management 
actions to reduce uncertainty through experimentation. The main advantages of AM are that 
it provides a mechanism for decision makers to adapt management to a changing 
environment and that it takes into account m 
anagement alternatives and explicitly addresses 
uncertainties and minimise risks in the system. Despite the simplicity of the idea and the fact 
that the concept has existed for more than two decades, AM is still surprisingly little 
practiced.  
This review focuses on the lessons that can be learned for implementing AM for wildlife 
management in Scotland. First we review the obstacles and reasons for failure to implement 
AM. Then, based on this we suggest a framework 
for deciding whether AM is appropriate for 
a given case study and finally present a process-
orientated flowchart of the steps involved in 
successful AM. 
1.1    Experience from and obstacles to AM for species management 
In this first part of the report, we will focus on four main obstacles to AM for species 
management: uncertainty, monitoring, social-ecological synthesis and experimentation.  
1.1.1 Uncertainty 
Understanding and dealing with uncertainty is central to effective decision-making in 
management and conservation of natural resources but has often been ignored or dealt with 
on an ad hoc basis (Regan et al., 2002). The term itself is very broad and can be vague. If 
we are to tackle and overcome the obstacle of uncertainty in AM, it is useful to understand 
and break down the term into different components.  
Here we follow the definitions of (Milner-G
ulland and Rowcliffe, 2007) who divide uncertainty 
up into: 

      process uncertainty,  

 measurement uncertainty,  

      structural uncertainty, and  

      implementation uncertainty.  
Process uncertainty
 recognises that natural systems are inherently variable. For example, 
the weather and climate differ from year to year and between areas which may lead to 
variability in birth and death rates between years. For example, (Johnson et al., 2014) use a 
mean of 0.951 and standard deviation of 0.019 for the survival of pink-footed geese to 
calculate a new survival rate for each year in 
their model (5 year example: 0.97, 0.96, 0.94, 
0.95, 1.00).  This type of uncertainty is incorporated in field data and can be represented 
using statistical techniques such as mean values with their standard errors, standard 
deviations or confidence limits. 
Measurement uncertainty 
stems from the imprecise 
measurement itself, for example measuring the weight of an animal or the temperature of a 
page 8

lake but can also arise from estimating parameter 
s (e.g. survival rates of birds) from a range 
of data (e.g. mark-recapture, GPS tagged individuals). 
Structural uncertainty
 comes from 
an incomplete understanding of the system or 
the situation. For example, one might expect 
that the increase or decrease in numbers of a certain species or population is linear whereas 
it is actually following a non-linear (e.g. quadratic or cubic) trend. This would mean that an 
initial slow increase is misinterpreted as a slow change that can be linearly predicted 
relatively far into the future, whereas it is actually the beginning of a steep increase in 
numbers (Di Fonzo et al., 2013). Finally, 
implementation uncertainty
 is where it is unclear 
whether the decisions made can actually be tr
anslated into action and whether the people 
involved in this action have understood what is required, have the capacity to implement it, 
and finally have been provided with the incentives to implement the actions.  
We will outline below different tools that can help AM to tackle various uncertainties: 
measurement uncertainty can be addressed in m
onitoring, structural uncertainty through 
experimentation and modelling and implementation uncer
tainty by collecting social data from 
the people involved. Process uncertainty, for exam
ple because of climatic variability, is the 
only uncertainty that AM is not able to address. 
1.1.2 Monitoring 
Monitoring is crucial to reduce uncertainty because it can capture process uncertainty (e.g. 
changes in weather affecting wildlife) and measurement uncertainty (e.g. repeated 
monitoring for validation). However, there has recently been an increasing realisation that 
monitoring for AM can be complex and inadequate (Legg and Nagy, 2006). If done badly, 
monitoring can misinform managers and waste valuable resources and thus form barriers for 
an AM approach. Because AM recognises that the resource and species to be managed is 
affected by and affects people, evidence to support management aims is unlikely to be just 
ecological and it is necessary to m 
onitor social and economic dynamics.  
The first step in monitoring is to consider the aims, the indicators that would measure 
progress towards the aim, the range of methods available to measure the indicator and the 
system and the species involved. The aim of monitoring can often be divided into estimating 
accurate population size and estimating the population trend. If the aim is to measure the 
trend then it is important that monitoring is precise (repeatability of estimates) but not 
necessarily accurate (how close is the estimate to the true value); precision often leads to a 
significant reduction in resources needed compared to carrying out accurate estimates of 
population size (Nuno et al., 2013a, Nichols and Williams, 2006). Furthermore it is important 
to ask over what time period can the changes of interest be detected. For example, 
Bunnefeld et al. (2013) show that for a species with slow life history, such as a large 
ungulate in Africa, it would take up to ten years to have enough confidence in the estimated 
trend to set hunting quotas sustainably. Not only the amount of data matters, it is also crucial 
to collect data that can be linked to the change in the actual population increase or 
decrease. For example, Katzner et al. (2006) showed that using the proportion of occupied 
territories was not a good indicator of population change for eagles in Kazakhstan whereas 
adult survival has a more direct effect on the population trends and is thus a better indicator 
to monitor.  
A key feature of AM is the recognition that management is dealing with a socio-ecological 
system, so that there are social and economic is
sues as well as ecological ones that need to 
be addressed if management is to be effective. 
Failure to address socio-economic factors is 
one of the main obstacles for effective AM implementation. Therefore, AM should monitor 
the social and economic as well as the ecological goals so that management actions can be 
revised in response to undesirable changes in 
social and economic indicators. For example, 
loss of income from a perceived loss of grazing land might affect farmers’ willingness to 
tolerate the increase in goose numbers resulting from goose conservation management, 
page 9

possibly leading to non-cooperation from farmers and a subsequent breakdown in the 
sustainable management of geese despite understandi
ng the ecology of the system. Social 
science techniques have been developed that are especially suited to monitor the effect of 
management actions on local people’s wellbeing and livelihoods and thus reduce the 
uncertainty about whether the AM project is su
ccessful and socially sustainable. The main 
techniques for monitoring the socio-economic 
impacts are participatory rural appraisal 
(PRA), questionnaire surveys, and direct observations (Milner-Gulland and Rowcliffe, 2007). 
PRA involves interviews with key informants in a community and community mapping to get 
information on land use issues. This method can be used for example when information is 
needed relatively quickly and the inclusion of local communities can empower them 
(Cornwall and Pratt, 2011). Questionnaire surveys are often in the form of prepared 
questions together with open discussions to obtain other information relevant to the 
particular context in which management is o
ccurring (semi-structured interviews). This 
technique is useful when more resources are sufficient to gather information from large 
numbers of people affected by management actions. Direct observations can include prices 
for agricultural produce over the season or
 differences between years, payments for 
ecosystem services received, household income or taxes paid. A direct observation 
technique called participant observation has been used in AM; participant observation 
follows a key person in the course of their activities to develop an understanding of 
motivations, attitudes and barriers to changes (Allan and Curtis, 2005). A combination of 
direct observations and questionnaire surveys can overcome the problem that attitudes 
estimated from questionnaires do not always translate into behaviour and activities people 
are involved in (Heberlein, 2012). For example, 
a survey carried out in Sweden by the same 
author showed that 84 people that did not hunt had a negative attitude towards hunting, 
which makes sense. However, there were 337 people that had a positive attitude towards 
hunting (e.g. enjoyed eating game meat) but did not hunt either. The analysis showed that 
attitudes explained less than 10% of the variation in hunting participation.  
One outcome of policy goals for wildlife is that people may disagree with new regulations 
and laws implemented which can lead to non-compliance and illegal behaviour. The AM 
process is, in principle, a mechanism to r
educe this risk by allowing management actions to 
be revised if changes in social and economic indicators are undesirable.  This means that 
monitoring needs to be planned in advance to detect the changes that may lead to non-
compliance and illegal behaviour, particularly in rural areas where it may be hard to enforce 
wildlife and environmental laws and detect t
hese behaviours. The true extent of illegal 
activities is hard to quantify due to the cryptic nature of the behaviour (Gavin et al. 2010), but 
there is a range of methods developed to achieve this. These include law-enforcement 
records, key informants and self-reporting (Gavin et al. 2010). Recently a range of indirect 
questioning methods has been developed to elicit 
the extent of illegal behaviour and their 
incentives while protecting their anonymity (St John et al., 2010, St John et al., 2012, Cross 
et al., 2013). The idea behind these methods is that people are more likely to give honest 
answers when their anonymity is protected (Lensvelt-Mulders et al., 2005) which has been 
tested in, for example, health insurance fraud (Bockenholt and van der Heijden, 2007). Nuno 
et al. (2013b) have used an indirect questioning technique in villages on the border with the 
Serengeti National Park in Tanzania to assess the proportion of people involved in illegal 
behaviour and their educational and economic circumstances; people with higher education 
and a full time job are more likely to hunt bushmeat because they are able to pay the fees if 
they are caught.  
In summary, monitoring ecological and socio-ec
onomic aspects can reduce uncertainty of 
knowing whether AM programmes will succeed but it is crucial to go through a process of 
identifying the aims and objectives of management and the indicators to be monitored that 
inform the success of management.

1.1.3    Social-ecological synthesis and conservation conflicts 
Social-ecological synthesis as a conceptual framework is a fundamental concept in AM 
because virtually all management and conservation challenges involve people as well as the 
resources or species being managed (Keith et al., 2011). AM is often applied in case studies 
that face trade-offs between different land m
anagement types (for example agriculture vs. 
wetlands) and there is only one outcome and winner in such a situation. Most often these 
conflicts arise when stakeholders have opposite vi 
ews representing for example, farmers or 
conservationists. One key challenge is that consensus and cooperation in many of these 
situations is often not possible (Colyvan et al., 2011, Redpath et al., 2013). To agree on a 
management plan and implement it, it is crucial that all key stakeholders are included in the 
AM process to work towards minimising conflicts and the socio-economic impacts need to be 
recognised and possibly compensated for. AM can be used as an approach to help find a 
way through intractable conflict by bringing stakeholders together to examine the evidence 
and co-develop their knowledge which will help in reducing conflicts. 
An inclusive approach should aim to test different management approaches to provide 
evidence of what works and of the nature and size of the trade-offs that are inherent if the 
conflict only has one winner. 
1.1.4    Barriers to experiments  
AM is all about learning from system re
sponses to past actions and updating management 
strategies accordingly. The ideal way to disentangle many confounding factors such as 
variation in weather differences between years and the effect of management is to test 
alternative strategies against each other in an experimental set up with replication. However, 
the time and resources required and the spatial area needed to conduct an experiment often 
make them unfeasible for providing timely 
evidence to inform new management directions. 
Furthermore, institutional barriers can play a role where the context requires multiple 
stakeholders to agree on an experimental procedure across an area characterised by 
multiple ownership, (Keith et al., 2011). The use of appropriate knowledge in AM is a 
fundamental principle and in some cases, experts, such as scientists have demonstrated the 
capacity and knowledge to analyse complex data sets which has been accepted by 
stakeholders leading to successful AM implementation. For example, in the case of duck 
harvesting in the US and goose management in Norway, scientists have been crucial in 
analysing the data obtained from experiments. Im
portantly, in both these cases stakeholders 
accepted these data as a knowledge base for the decision-making process (Tombre et al., 
2013, Nichols et al., 2007) and this may not always be the case in other situations. 
2.    WHERE IS AM APPROPRIATE, FEASIBLE, SUCCESSFUL? 
2.1 Appropriate 
AM is used as a framework for decision-making in complex systems that are affected by 
uncertainty. AM is therefore a process of understanding and reducing some of the sources of 
uncertainty. In virtually all cases where population abundance is estimated, uncertainty 
remains but it is important to understand and tackle this uncertainty. An example where AM 
can be most effective in reducing uncertainty is when estimating population abundance. For 
example, catch per unit effort (CPUE) has been useful in estimating trends of population 
sizes in fishing, bag and shooting data (Williams et al., 2002) . AM can be helpful by 
removing different proportions as part of an experiment which can be used to calculate 
CPUE. 
Although some scientists (Rist 
et al
., 2013) restrict the appropriateness of adaptive 
management to ecological uncertainty, most studies now show that uncertainty surrounding 
page 11

5 
people is equally difficult to assess.  Reducing uncertainty about how people behave in the 
system and whether they follow new rules and regulations can be crucial to planning AM, 
especially when behaviour is socially accepted but illegal. For example, in a study on 
farmers killing carnivores in South Africa, St John et al. (2012) used an indirect questioning 
technique and showed that farmers believing their peers are involved in killing protected 
carnivores, increased their likelihood to be involved in carnivore killing. AM can help to 
reduce the uncertainty of illegal behaviour by building understanding of the motivations of 
people’s behavior in order to design more appropriate interventions that should have a 
higher likelihood of success.  
While AM is able to address a range of uncertainties as outlined above, some remain 
outside the appropriateness of AM. For example, process uncertainty due to climate change 
and variation in weather from year to year resu
lting in changes in fecundity or survival is 
impossible to reduce through AM because it is a 
ffected by many external drivers that cannot 
be controlled in the system to be managed and often involve delayed feedbacks.  
Thus for AM to be appropriate, it is necessary to address the social and ecological obstacles 
and uncertainties and this can be achieved through further studies and experiments. 
Experiments can be carried in natural system
s by applying different management regimes to 
different areas. For example, AM of US waterfowl applies one of three different hunting 
regulations (liberal, moderate or conservative based on daily bag limits and hunting season) 
to each of the four US waterfowl flyways (Nichols et al., 2007). Therefore, in some situations, 
the resources available for managing wildlife may be most usefully directed towards the 
collection of social and economic information rather than focusing on collecting more 
knowledge on the ecological aspects of the resource to be managed.  
2.2 Feasible 
The next question is whether the AM approach is feasible, which has two parts, resources 
and management flexibility. Before 
embracing an AM approach, clarification is required as to 
whether enough resources (funding and personnel) are available to carry out AM. This 
should include planning for testing alternative strategies (carrying out experiments) and 
monitoring the outcome of these.  
Management flexibility is a more complex topic but equally important. Institutional 
fragmentation, lack of leadership or conflicts within or between stakeholders can lead to a 
breakdown of decision-making processes and finally
 of the feasibility of the AM approach. 
Furthermore, goals and objectives of stakeholders might be set in stone and be rigid rather 
than flexible and adaptive. Therefore, developing a mo 
re flexible approach is a prerequisite if 
stakeholders are to take an adaptive approach to the issue at hand and to each other if they 
are to utilize the new insights gained from m
onitoring alternative management strategies and 
to develop new actions (Redpath et al., 2013). Multicriteria decision analysis can be used to 
establish a common ground and the nature of the differences, which can contribute to more 
flexible approaches in adaptive management, especially where conflicts between 
stakeholders create a barrier. Davies et al. (2013) used four case studies to explore the 
approach and showcase its general applicability: tourism and commercial and subsistence 
use of protected areas in Tobago, conservation and management of Ruaha National Park in 
Tanzania, forest managers and reindeer herders in Finnish Lapland and moorland 
management and hen harriers in Scotland.  
2.3 Successful 
The first step when asking whether AM was a success is to check whether the main 
prerequisites of appropriateness and feasibility were complied with. Without these, AM 
approaches are doomed to be unsuccessful. If AM is appropriate and feasible, the next step 
page 12

6 
should be to set up measurable indicators appropriate to the goals that can be monitored 
given the limited funds available. The first criter
ion for success should be that uncertainty is 
reduced and it is important that this applies both to the ecological and socio-economic 
uncertainty. It is important to understand whether there is reduced uncertainty in the 
knowledge on how the ecosystem responds to the management actions and reduced 
uncertainty as to how people’s socio-econom
ics, livelihoods and wellbeing are affected by 
management strategies. The steps described here can be found in Annex 1 as outline 
guidance on how to carry out AM.
3.    HOW TO DO IT 
The most important message from the literature on successes and failures is that AM is a 
process rather than a strict or prescriptive guideline. AM can be summarised by 4 main 
phases: i) setting clear management objectives, ii) 
testing alternative solutions iii) monitoring 
and iv) structured decision-making. First, overall 
objectives
 and targets for tackling the 
challenge or conflict need to be agreed. The sy
stem and context should be evaluated: the 
issues and challenges need to be identified and relevant knowledge and data should be 
collated. At this stage, potential synergies (win-win) between different stakeholder 
objectives, trade-offs and conflicts with potential lose-lose outcomes should be assessed. 
Second, for AM to work, actions and their 
alternative actions and solutions
 have to be 
chosen. A conceptual model is needed at this stage to clearly predict the response of the 
system to the different management actions based on stakeholder experience and 
knowledge and if possible a mathematical model is created to test these predictions 
quantitatively. The action plan and its uncertainties are decided and discussed at this stage 
and should consider all parts of the system so that the social, economic and ecological 
components are taken into account to avoid the pitfall of AM failure because the plan only 
addresses ecological or economic factors in isolation. The third phase – 
monitoring
 - 
requires clear indicators of social, econom
ic, ecological and biodiversity change. A 
conceptual model or mathematical model should investigate the most cost-efficient methods 
to achieve effectiveness. Often it is only 
necessary to know the trend, which requires 
precision (repeatability) rather than an accurate estimate of the population size. Knowing the 
uncertainty together with the estimates will then feed back into the assessment part of the 
AM approach. A 
structured decision-making
 process uses the knowledge gained from 
experimentation and monitoring to evaluate the outcomes against the objectives. Structured 
decision-making provides a tool to adapt objectives and alternative management plans and 
solutions.   
3.1 Tools 
The following section presents a range of tools that can help to explore alternative 
management scenarios. Please also see Annex 1 for guidance on how the tools fit with the 
AM cycle and Annex 2 for an AM workshop report with SNH staff.  
3.1.1 Game theory 
Decision-making for conservation and management of natural resources is often on a 
continuum between conflict and cooperation and game theory can be helpful to move 
between the two extremes. In game theory the outcome of a conflict situation can be a win 
or lose for the parties involved, which is called zero sum because if one party gains the other 
loses. However, there are also possibilities of win-win situations or lose-lose situations, 
which are non-zero sum outcomes. The contribution of game theory is to make stakeholders 
aware that there are opportunities to get away from a win-lose situation and to move towards 
alternative outcomes where both parties may gai
n or compromise on their goals to achieve a 
more robust, conflict-free outcome (Redpath et al., 2013).

3.1.2    Multi criteria decision analysis 
Multi-criteria decision analysis is a decision support tool that decomposes complex systems 
into smaller units and takes into account that most natural systems are social-ecological 
systems and thus are bound to have multiple, often competing, objectives (Davies et al., 
2013). The core idea is that multiple criteria for success are defined, weighted and ranked 
and that management options are scored agains
t these criteria. This process allows 
combining scores and ranks into a value, which can be used to discuss management 
actions, outcomes and criteria for success am
ong stakeholders. This can reduce conflicts 
between stakeholders by linking action, outcomes and objectives and thus showing the 
trade-offs between different objectives. 
3.1.3    Expected value of perfect information 
AM is ideally suited to address and take into account various uncertainties. But knowing that 
resources are limited, which uncertainty should 
be tackled first is an important question. The 
theory of Expected Value of Perfect Information addresses the challenge of prioritising 
among a range of factors contributing to uncertainty (Runge et al., 2011). EVPI is the 
difference between the expected value of an optimal action after the new information is 
available and the expected value of an optimal action before the information is available. 
This can be measured in monetary terms or as ut
ility (social services, cultural values etc.) 
and thus is flexible enough to be used in different circumstances and different aims of 
management and conservation. For example, Runge et al. (2011) used EVPI for the 
management of whooping cranes (
Grus americana
) to decide whether habitat restoration, 
minimizing human disturbance or killing parasites (black flies) would be the best action under 
monitoring and parameter uncertainty. Habitat restoration came out as the best option as it 
had a direct positive effect on reproductive success in whooping cranes which monitoring 
showed was non-existent in previous years. Reducing the uncertainty to zero according to 
the EVPI would increase performance by 20% measured as the reproductive success of the 
cranes.  
3.1.4    Management strategy evaluation 
One successful approach to bring together social and ecological dynamics and to reduce 
uncertainty is the management strategy ev
aluation (MSE) framework which was developed 
first for fisheries and has since become the dominant approach within the field (Butterworth 
and Punt, 1999). Management Strategy Evaluati
on (MSE) creates models wherein a range 
of alternative management scenarios can be developed based on the dynamics of the 
natural world and the social relationships of stakeholders. MSE is then able to predict the 
effect of multiple scenarios and management actions on the social-ecological system, which 
can be compared to targets. MSE models the 
whole system including the dynamics of the 
social-ecological system, the monitoring process, the assessment and decision making 
process, and the stakeholders implementing the decisions. This allows for evaluating 
multiple targets, which can also involve trade-offs. Thus, MSE can elicit trade-offs and non-
consensus outcomes of conflicts by using scenarios rather than single solutions to target-
setting and environmental management. In fisherie
s, the application of the MSE framework 
has, in many cases, led to a better commitm
ent to the agreed procedure by all stakeholders 
because of its transparency and ability to demonstrate the effects of assumptions about all 
components of a management system (Smith et
 al., 2008). Recently the framework has 
been extended to include more realistic trade-offs between socio-economic and ecological 
sustainability through explicitly modeling resource-user decision-making (Bunnefeld et al., 
2011, Little et al., 2009). This has now been tested for trophy hunting of a large ungulate, the 
mountain nyala in Ethiopia, and of lions across Africa (Bunnefeld et al., 2013, Edwards et al., 
2014). The most impressive real world success of the MSE approach is  that it has helped to 
cut down from several weeks to less than two days the time  needed to negotiate between 
page 14

8 
fishermen, conservationists and the tourist industry to decide on the resource use around the 
Great Barrier Reef in Australia (Smith et al., 2008)   
In the case of trophy hunting (mountain nyala and lions) there are two conflicting objectives. 
First, there is the objective to stop the population decline and ensure the recovery of the 
species; lions have seen a steady population decline in the last 10 years and for the 
mountain nyala we know from a monitoring st
udy carried out in 2011 that there are only 
3000-4000 individuals left. The second objective is to increase the revenue brought in from 
hunting to pay for conservation actions (monitoring, habitat protection from agriculture and 
deforestation, anti-poaching). The MSE approach can be used to find strategies that allow 
increasing the quota for hunting when population numbers are increasing (e.g. due to 
protection of land from encroachment and poachi
ng). Thus, the initially competing objectives 
of population recovery and increasing income 
from hunting can be linked through carefully 
setting quotas. While this task seems straight forward, it becomes more difficult when 
considering uncertainty. Both studies are am
ong the first to acknowledge that there are 
major uncertainties around the estimates of the population abundance. In the case of lions, 
many hunting areas lack any long-term population abundance data but sometimes data on 
off-takes exist (Packer et al., 2011). Scientific monitoring of mountain nyala is now carried 
out regularly in the Bale Mountains National Park in Ethiopia but most hunting areas are only 
visited for an inspection every two years (Kinahan and Bunnefeld, 2012). The two studies 
are among the first to recognise that uncertainty is high in these case studies and that this 
needs to be taken into account and tackled when making decisions. In both case studies, the 
accurate population size of lions and nyala is unknown and indirect measurements are 
instead used to determine the trend of the population. Indirect measurements are the catch 
per unit effort, i.e. the searching time it takes to find and shoot a lion as a measure of relative 
change in abundance from one year to the next. An index of the relative change in the 
number counted has been used in the model; 
this monitoring programme has been proven 
more cost effective and feasible than a full monitoring programme to determine the exact 
population size of nyala or lions. Running simulations of the model under various degrees of 
monitoring budget and uncertainty reveal minimum investment to make informed decisions. 
A further important precautionary principle in the model was that only small changes in the 
quota are allowed from one year to the next in 
order not to overexploit the population. The 
best rate of quota change (e.g. 10%, 20%, etc.) can be determined through a simulation 
approach in the MSE framework. In conclusion, the MSE approach is able to suggest 
strategies that can balance competing objectives when uncertainty is high.   
3.1.5    Hard vs. soft targets 
In the conservation and management literature, there has been a call for hard targets, where 
the aim is to achieve a quantifiable change in the system. Conservationists often favour hard 
targets because success can be measured after a ce
rtain time frame. For example, for the 
Russian/European barnacle goose the reduction of the population should have a target to be 
able to assess the success of the action aimed at reducing the population size (Williams and 
Madsen, 2013). An example of a soft target would be the aim of reducing the population size 
of a conflict species without risking extincti
on to alleviate the pressure on landowners 
because this would allow further negotiations between stakeholders. In fact, in the case of 
Svalbard pink-footed geese the Norwegian government has set no upper target for the 
population size but rather have set upper targets for the damage these species cause 
(Williams and Madsen, 2013). In the same study, farmers raised the issue that it is even 
unrealistic to reduce the population size but it might be a better target to control the growth. 
Thus soft targets allow measuring some form of reduction in socio-economic pressure 
without jeopardizing the conservation status of a species. The approach of setting hard 
targets has been criticised because they are o
ften unrealistic and unachievable, inflexible 
and override stakeholder judgement and it is almost impossible to include the complexity of 
social-ecological systems when setting hard targets (Carwardine et al., 2009).

3.2    Two case studies 
3.2.1 Case study 
1 – Adaptive Harvest Management of duck hunting in the United States 
In 1995, the US Fish and Wildlife Service started to use an adaptive management approach 
for ducks. The AM framework consists of formulating objectives, carrying out alternative 
management actions, predictive modelling and a monitoring programme. The objectives are 
formulated as objective functions and formal statements that can be translated into a 
mathematical function. For example the objective of the duck hunting is to maximise long 
term cumulative harvest penalized for when population size falls below a minimum set by the 
management plan. Each year different areas in the US receive one of the three alternative 
harvesting regimes (liberal, moderate, conservative) limiting the number of hunter days and 
season length. A range of four predictive models is used each year to predict the population 
size of ducks. The models reflect variation in density-dependent reproductive rates and 
levels of hunting intensity interacting with nat 
ural mortality (additive vs. compensatory). Each 
year monitoring is carried out by governmental and private partners. A review after 12 years 
of using AM for ducks showed that two factors have been crucial for the success: (1) an 
iterative learning approach where all elements are annually reviewed and updated and (2) a 
close collaboration between stakeholders and scientists (Nichols et al., 2007). Hunter 
satisfaction and social science approaches have been discussed and suggested as a way 
forward to set objectives but have so far not been implemented.  
3.2.2    Case study 2 – Adaptive management of pink footed geese in Norway 
Russian/European barnacle geese and Svalbard pink-footed geese numbers have doubled 
or tripled over the last few decades. Along the flyway, many European countries share the 
increase in goose numbers and the different staging areas are affected to a varying extent. 
Countries affected by rising geese numbers include the UK, Belgium, The Netherlands, 
Denmark and Norway. A recent paper by Tombre et
 al. (2013) outlines the process of using 
AM to manage the two goose populations as a response to the increasing numbers but also 
the spatial expansion of the geese. The AM project involves three main groups of 
stakeholders: conservationists (Birdlife Norway, Directorate for Nature Management), 
stakeholders with agricultural interests (Farmer’s Union) and hunters (Norwegian 
Association of Hunters and Anglers). At the start of the AM project, stakeholder incentives, 
objectives and roles were identified, which lead to a clear understanding of the conflict 
between different stakeholders. A range of tools was put in place to make decisions on the 
different potential actions: compensation, hunting and scaring. A species distribution model 
was developed to predict the goose distribution in time and space and to form a basis for 
compensation payments. An optimal hunting m 
odel to reduce population size was developed 
for the autumn season. Since geese were feeding on private land, famers and landowners 
were directly involved in the management and data gathering. Farmers were actively 
participating in the experiments to estimate the success of scaring schemes and devices, 
which were then fed into the goose distribution model. Scientists provided knowledge on the 
population estimates and grazing intensity; all stakeholders accepted this knowledge as a 
solid base for negotiations and decisions. To resolve the conflict between the different 
stakeholders, a compensation scheme, hunting quotas and a scaring scheme was initiated. 
Targets and action plans were developed for all three schemes and all stakeholders agreed 
that conflicts could only be mitigated by reducing the population size as well as using 
compensation payments and scaring.
 By using an AM approach, objectives, targets and 
action plans are reviewed every year and decisio
ns are based on the latest information from 
monitoring and are flexible to change. The study finds that these are important aspects in a 
successful AM.

ANNEX 1: ADAPTIVE MANAGEMENT APPROACHES – THE AUTHORS’ SUGGESTED 
OUTLINE GUIDANCE 
Synopsis 
Adaptive management (AM) is a tool to support 
effective decision making, through learning 
from system responses to past actions a
nd adapting management strategies accordingly. 
While the idea is simple and straightforward, the actual implementation of AM has proved 
challenging. In many cases, uncertainty may lead to undesirable outcomes or inertia 
because stakeholders fail to agree on appropriate management actions. AM has a huge 
potential to reduce this uncertainty by learning and applying alternative management 
strategies.  
These guidelines are designed to help identify when AM is appropriate, feasible and 
successful and the tools that are relevant to carry out and implement AM. These guidelines 
links closely with “A review of approaches for adaptive management” and more detail and 
explanation on each of the bullet points can be found in the review document (Bunnefeld, N., 
Redpath, S., & Irvine, J., 2014).   
1.   Evaluation (Figure 1)  
1.1. When is AM appropriate? 
AM is used as a framework for decision maki
ng in complex systems that are affected by 
uncertainty. AM is a process of understanding and reducing some of the sources of 
uncertainty. Before an AM project is started, it
 is crucial to ask whether AM is appropriate. It 
can be used: 

    When uncertainty in the ecological or so 
cio-economic system prevails and can be 
tackled through monitoring and experimentation 

   NOT when the uncertainty is unaffe
cted by an experiment or a project’s 
management activities, e.g. where the key source of uncertainty is climate 
change uncertainty 
1.2.   When is AM feasible? 
Before embracing an AM approach, clarification is required as to whether AM is feasible and 
especially whether enough resources are available and whether management flexibility 
exists to carry out AM 
o
    Are appropriate resources and funding available? 
o
   Are alternative management actions suggested and possible for different 
areas to learn in a few years about system responses to different actions? 
Are ecological experiments considered, developed and funded to tease apart 
different factors affecting the system? 
o
   Is a monitoring programme developed and funded to be able to learn and 
adapt over the years? This involves setting up measurable indicators 
appropriate to the goals that can be monitored given the limited funds 
available. 
o
    Is the project management sy
stem flexible enough to adapt? 

   Can institutional fragmentation between different departments or 
areas of expertise be overcome to enable/allow adaptation? 

    Is leadership and ownership of who makes decisions and carries out 
AM actions clearly set out? 

    Are goals and objectives formulated in a way that they are flexible to 
adapt?

1.3.   When is AM successful? 
Assuming the prerequisites of appropriateness and feasibility are met, the first criteria for 
success should be that ecological and socio-economic uncertainty is reduced. Is there less 
uncertainty in: 
o
   Ecological uncertainty; the knowledge of how the ecosystem responds to the 
management actions and  
o
  Socio-economic uncertainty; people’s socio-economics, livelihoods and 
wellbeing are affected by management strategies.  
2.   The tools to carry out AM (Figure 1) 
2.1. 
Setting clear objectives together with stakeholders 
Overall objectives and targets for tackling the challenge need to be agreed. The system and 
context should be evaluated: the issues and challenges need to be identified and relevant 
knowledge and data should be collated 

    What is the existing knowledge about the system?  
o
   What ecological (e.g. reproductive rates, harvest rates, catch per unit 
effort etc) data is available?  
o
   What social data is available (who hunts, what is the social impact of the 
animals) what is the economic data available (cost of hunting, cost of 
damage etc)? 

    Where is the uncertainty in the system and can the data be used to reduce this or 
does new data need to be collected? 

    Identify the stakeholders and include them in the AM process 

    Identify management issues  

    Decide on the main objective  
o
    Tools to set objectives can include: 

    Face to face interviews 

 Group discussions 
2.2.   Decide on management actions and their alternatives 
For AM to work, actions and their alternative actions and solutions have to be chosen. This 
can be done as part of an experimental set up or by applying different actions to different 
areas or sites in a system. A conceptual model
 is needed at this stage to predict system 
responses to the different management actions. It will be based on stakeholder experience 
and knowledge. If possible a mathematical model is created to test these predictions 
quantitatively.  These decisions are often best made through group discussion with 
individuals suggesting alternatives and their advantages to the group.  The group can: 

    Ask: Are multiple sites affected and can different management actions 
be applied to different sites? 

    Agree actions: Where and when and how long to carry out AM?  

    Encourage experimentation with the system to learn from the action 
and compare with the ‘business as usual’ activities 
2.3.   Develop a monitoring programme 
Monitoring is an essential element of AM and focuses on the indicators defined earlier. A 
conceptual or mathematical model should investigate the most cost-efficient methods to 
achieve effectiveness; often, it is only necessary to know the trend, which requires precision 
(repeatability) rather than an accurate estimate of, for example, the population size. Knowing 
page 21

15 
the uncertainty together with the estimates will then feed back into the assessment part of 
the AM approach. 
o
 Ecological monitoring 

   Decide on the appropriate indicator (population trends, absolute 
numbers, a surrogate such as habitat quality) 
o
    Socio-economic monitoring.  

    Decide on the indicators relevant to the socio-economic impacts 

    Collect data on attitudes and motivations of the different stakeholders 
in order to understand how they may react to particular management 
interventions 
o
  Is monitoring cost-efficient and effective, i.e. does data collected from 
monitoring deliver measurable indicators of system change in the most cost-
efficient way based on monitoring costs? Consider alternatives at this stage 
and repeat the AM tools check list.  
2.4.   Build a structured decision-making framework 
A structured decision-making process uses the knowledge gained from experimentation and 
monitoring to evaluate the outcomes against the objectives. Structured decision-making 
provides a tool to adapt objectives and alternative management plans and solutions.   
o
    Collate and interpret data from ecological and socio-economic monitoring 
o
   Make decisions for management actions
 using a decision making tool (e.g. 
game theory, multi-criteria decision analysis, expected value of perfect 
information, management strategy evaluation)  

    Identify trade-offs, synergies and win-win situations of management 
actions 

    Choose management actions based on decision making tools 
o
   Use expert knowledge to make pred
ictions based on qualitative approaches 
(expert opinions) on the social, economic, ecological and biodiversity changes 
o
    Adapt goals, objectives and actions 
o
   Start from 2.1 to set clear management objectives and from 1.1 if unsure 
whether AM is still appropriate, feasible, successful

ANNEX 2: ADAPTIVE MANAGEMENT WORKSHOP 
Held at SNH Battleby office, Perth 29/03/2014  
The aim of the workshop was to familiarise SNH staff with the adaptive management (AM) 
framework and to identify potential barriers. In order to do this the workshop was divided into 
3 main sessions: i) presentation of a summary of the review of adaptive management, ii) 
breakout groups discussing the application of the adaptive management framework to three 
species/systems (geese, white tailed eagles and beaver) and iii) plenary discussion of the 
general barriers for adaptive management arising from the species/system case studies. 
The species/systems break out groups produced i) a list of points on how adaptive 
management could work in their specific sy
stems and ii) identified potential barriers to 
engaging with and implementation of adaptive 
management.  The discussion is described 
below. 
How Adaptive Management could work in a specific system 
The groups were asked to follow the AM stages using the case studies as a focus. The 
stages include identifying the key stakeholders, setting objectives, identifying alternative 
management actions, developing monitoring protocols and structured decision-making.  
All groups developed objectives, management actions and monitoring but the   eagle group 
also identified key stakeholders during the workshop, it became clear that setting objectives 
with competing views from different stakeholders can be a challenge. A useful step towards 
tackling this is to identify the stakeholders in the system explicitly and to engage them right 
at the start of AM process, i.e. already at the stage where objectives are defined. 
Management actions included the direct manag
ement of the system (habitat management, 
species management) but also risk assessment. AM
 actions should be interventions that can 
be learned from, for example applying alternative actions to compare outcomes.   
Monitoring was ongoing in all three case studies and included both ecological monitoring of 
the focal species as well as the impact on agriculture and other land use; monitoring 
feedback from stakeholders; economic and social impact and monitoring economic variables 
(e.g. market sales of meat).  
Structured decision making was less clearly worked out in the three case studies - partly 
because of a lack of time and spending more time on other parts. A structured decision 
making approach presents a challenge because for it to be useful to AM it needs to 
incorporate ecological and socio-economic knowledge and data and should be evidence 
based, transparent and repeatable.  
Barriers to Adaptive Management 
The following summary of the barriers discussed during the workshop follows the structure of 
the Review of Adaptive Management document.  
Uncertainty 
Reducing uncertainty is one of the aims of an AM approach. However, uncertainty can be an 
obstacle for both engaging in AM and implementing it. During the workshop two main issues 
with uncertainty emerged. First was the length of time it will take to achieve a result and 
uncertainty of the associated costs of a project of unknown length. Second, a barrier for 
starting AM projects was the uncertainty 
in terms of risk of unintended or unwanted 
page 24

18 
outcomes from potential management actions on t
he system in terms of the ecological and 
socio-economic consequences.  
Monitoring 
Monitoring is a key component of AM in providing the evidence for the effectiveness of 
actions on the objectives. However, the levels of information required from monitoring and 
the associated costs can prevent AM being init
iated, implemented or continued. Concerns 
have been raised during the workshop that the local managers are expected to set up an 
extensive monitoring scheme that might exceed t 
he available funding; thus AM is not started 
to avoid costs that exceed funding levels. Furthermore, the costs of monitoring can create 
resistance to becoming involved in, and committed to, a long-term project.  
Social-ecological barriers 
AM recognises that social and economic 
factors need to be considered when setting 
objectives and designing actions. The discussions highlighted the general feeling that it is 
hard to set management objectives and that this prevents the initiation and implementation 
of AM. The main reason for this is the large number of stakeholders who often have 
conflicting interests, for example conservationists and ornithologists, livestock farmers, 
government agencies, tourist industry, rural communities and politicians. It is perceived to be 
difficult to formulate competing objectives that represent the interests of the different 
stakeholders. Thus, starting the AM process and implementing AM can be hindered by 
conflicts between stakeholders, low levels of willingness to compromise and the lack of 
understanding of other stakeholder’s incentives. These can be summarised as lack of trust 
and lack of transparency among competing interests.  
Furthermore, bureaucracy as well as policies at a national level can build barriers to 
developing an AM approach at a local level. Political inertia was also mentioned as another 
barrier. This is linked to a lack of clarity 
over who has the ownership of the management 
actions and the associated challenges.  
Experimentation 
Experimentation is a key feature of AM. This is different to trying one approach and then 
trying another. It means perturbing the system 
and learning from the monitoring how the 
system responds by making use of the data, which should help reduce uncertainty. Ideally 
this means applying an action to part of the system and comparing it with another area 
where the action is not applied. However, there was a general feeling that there is a lack of 
opportunity for experimentation in the case studies discussed. In relation to this, in some 
cases, it was felt that there is also a lack of evidence that AM experiments will work to 
achieve the objectives. It was also perceived that there is a lack of capacity to deliver the 
management actions (experiment) in order to achieve the objectives. 
Finally, although AM should reduce uncertainty and increase effectiveness through 
implementing management actions based on incl 
usive stakeholder engagement in objective 
setting, this can lead to problems with managing raised expectations of stakeholders as well 
as public relations issues in relation to the communication of alternative scenarios and 
actions based on experimentation that may not be clear to the wider public.  
Summary  
Participants were in principle supportive of using an AM approach to managing wildlife and 
also felt that managing habitats as well as individual species using this approach should be 
considered. The workshop raised participants’ knowledge and understanding of the AM 
process as distinct from current wildlife management approaches. However, issues with 
page 25

19 
implementing AM were also identified. From 
the first session, participants experienced how 
complex even abstract objective setting can be when there are competing objectives 
representing different stakeholders. While monitoring and including stakeholders was 
worked through in some detail in all groups, decision making and testing alternative solutions 
was less well explored.  
The second exercise focusing on the barriers of AM highlighted the need to improve social 
science skills to understand the social impacts that wildlife and wildlife management can 
have and how these impacts affect stakeholders. The breakout groups also clearly 
highlighted that monitoring the impact of management on wildlife and biodiversity as well as 
on the socio-economics of people needs the appropriate funding to build social capital by 
learning from true adaptive process  
Adaptive management is all about reducing uncerta 
inty and adapting action by learning from 
the past. Most natural systems are nowadays c
oupled social-ecological systems and for AM 
to be successful it needs to take into account all parts of the system.  
In general, the participants agreed that a useful next step would be to engage one of the 
case studies in an adaptive management proce 
ss as a learning exercise and to develop best 
practice in this methodology.
